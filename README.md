Explorations of type systems
----------------------------

This repo contains the relevant files that I produced
during my semester project on type systems in spring 2013.

Most of the work is related to the DOT (Dependent Object Types) Project,
see https://github.com/namin/dot for the code and http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~amin/dot/fool.pdf
for the paper.
